Our approach is based on an application of the log-Gaussian Cox process, which is a commonly used model in the spatial statistics literature but rarely used in astronomy. This method is applied to the globular cluster data obtained from the PIPER survey, a Hubble Space Telescope imaging program targeting the Perseus cluster. We successfully detect all confirmed ultra-diffuse galaxies with known globular cluster populations in the survey. We also identify a potential galaxy that has no detected diffuse stellar content. Preliminary analysis shows that it is unlikely to be merely an accidental clump of globular clusters or other objects. If confirmed, this system would be the first of its kind. Simulations are used to assess how the physical parameters of the globular cluster systems within ultra-diffuse galaxies affect their detectability using our method. We quantify the correlation of the detection probability with the total number of globular clusters in the galaxy and the anticorrelation with increasing half-number radius of the globular cluster system. The Sérsic index of the globular cluster distribution has little impact on detectability.","tags":null,"title":"Light from the Darkness: Detecting Ultra-diffuse Galaxies in the Perseus Cluster through Over-densities of Globular Clusters with a Log-Gaussian Cox Process","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dayi Li","Pauline Barmby"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640044800,"objectID":"8eeeb86e7d7f6a0a66ce08d365f02d19","permalink":"https://davidolohowski.github.io/publication/m33-paper/","publishdate":"2021-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/m33-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"We demonstrate the power of Gibbs point process models from the spatial statistics literature when applied to studies of resolved galaxies. We conduct a rigorous analysis of the spatial distributions of objects in the star formation complexes of M33, including giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and young stellar cluster candidates (YSCCs). We choose a hierarchical model structure from GMCs to YSCCs based on the natural formation hierarchy between them. This approach circumvents the limitations of the empirical two-point correlation function analysis by naturally accounting for the inhomogeneity present in the distribution of YSCCs. We also investigate the effects of GMCs' properties on their spatial distributions. We confirm that the distribution of GMCs and YSCCs are highly correlated. We found that the spatial distributions of YSCCs reaches a peak of clustering pattern at around 250 pc scale compared to a Poisson process. This clustering mainly occurs in regions where the galactocentric distance is greater than 4.5 kpc. Furthermore, the galactocentric distance of GMCs and their mass have  strong positive effects on the correlation strength between GMCs and YSCCs. We outline some possible implications of these findings for our understanding of the cluster formation process.","tags":null,"title":"Gibbs Point Process Model for Young Star Clusters in M33","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My name My Chinese name is 李大一， 李 (Li, don't think there's any issue with how to pronounce it) is the family name; 大一 (Dah Yee) is my first name.
