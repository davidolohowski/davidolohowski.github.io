Subsequently, I obtained my Masters degree in statistics in 2020 at Western University under the supervision of Ian McLeod and Pauline Barmby where I worked on spatial point process modelling of stellar objects in the M33 galaxy. I also worked a little bit on faciliating Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for certain models with intractable likelihood functions.\nIn general, I believe there is still an inadequacy of rigorous applications of advanced statistical methods in astronomy. Filling this inadequacy can bring about new understanding and discovery in astronomy and help us better understand the origin of the Universe. Therefore, I am interested in pushing proper statistical application in astronomy as well as developing new statistical methods to tackle challenging astronomical questions.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://davidolohowski.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. student in statistics advised by Gwen Eadie, Patrick Brown, and Roberto Abraham at the University of Toronto.

I then moved to Changsha for my high school education at Yali High School. After that, I came to Canada for my post-secondary education.\nHow to pronounce my name My Chinese name is 李大一， 李 (pinyin：Lǐ) is the family name; 大一 (pinyin: Dà Yī) is my first name and it is quite unique. According to the police record, there are only 3 people having the same name as me in my home province Hunan, which has a population of 67 million. So finding me wouldn't be that difficult.\nIf you find it difficult to pronounce my Chinese name, just stick with my English name David and I actually prefer it nowadays since people hardly get my Chinese name right. Although yelling David in a crowd will probably lead to many head-turnings and confusions.\nHobbies I draw and doodle in my spare time. In fact, I was aiming for a career as an artist all the way till high school. But I dropped it as a career path due to multiple reasons and it ended up as a hobby after high school. It still provides me with a lot of calm and comfort, however, and I enjoy the absolute freedom when I let my imagination loose.\nI am also a die-hard Barcelona fan simply because of the GOAT \u0026mdash; Lionel Messi. I don't think there should be any debate on whether Messi or Ronaldo is the best player of the world because Ronaldo is simply not on the same level as Messi, as supported by the analysis and results found in the following paper:\nTom Decroos, Lotte Bransen, Jan Van Haaren, and Jesse Davis, (2019) Actions Speak Louder than Goals: Valuing Player Actions in Soccer, In The 25th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’19).\nI also quite enjoy classical musics as well as movie scores when I need to focus and study. Debussy and Mozart are probably on the top of my list. Interstellar and Star Wars soundtracks are simply genius.\nI am also an avid fantasy/sci-fi fan. It might be cliche, but Star Wars, LOTR and Harry Potter can always make me go on and on.\n","date":1578182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578182400,"objectID":"a3614d944aeab6d541f0abe4c02e8f65","permalink":"https://davidolohowski.github.io/about-me/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about-me/","section":"","summary":"bio","tags":null,"title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Astrostatistics is an emerging and fast-growing cross-disciplinary field. It is at the intersection of astrophysics and statistics; it encompasses the application of modern statistical methodologies to astrophysics research, as well as the development of novel statistical methodologies for astrophysics which can lead to application in other scientific disciplines.\nI am a trained statistician, my research interests in statistics are mainly spatial statistics, Bayesian inference/computation, as well as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.\nMy Ph.D. work will focus on developing novel methodology in spatial point processes to help astronomers better detect a class of newly-found galaxies called the ultra-diffuse galaxies(UDGs). These galaxies are very hard to detect in that they have extremely low surface brightness (some only have 1% of the stars of the Milky Way Galaxy) but can be as much or more massive than the Milky Way (due to dark matter). However, it has been found that many of these galaxies have a significant population of globular clusters which can be served as a tracer for the location of their home UDGs. Developing methods and models to discover more of these galaxies can shed new light on our understanding of the Universe.\nIn my Masters thesis, I worked on developing spatial point process models to investigate the spatial distribution of stellar objects (CO filament, giant molecular clouds, star clusters) in the M33 galaxy. This is a novel methodology in astronomy and it has led to potential new discoveries in the formation of young stellar clusters.\n","date":1578182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578182400,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://davidolohowski.github.io/research/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"research","tags":null,"title":"About my research","type":"page"},{"authors":["Dayi Li","Pauline Barmby","Ian McLeod"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"8eeeb86e7d7f6a0a66ce08d365f02d19","permalink":"https://davidolohowski.github.io/publication/m33-paper/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/m33-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"We demonstrate the power of spatial statistical modelling when applied to stellar population studies. Using Gibbs point process (GPP) models in the spatial statistics literature, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the empirical spatial distributions of the stellar objects in M33, including CO filament, giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and young stellar clusters (YSCs). We choose a hierarchical model structure to characterize the spatial relations between CO filament, GMCs and YSCs. Bayesian inference is employed and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for GPP models are introduced. This work is a novel contribution compared to the current methodology employed where only a limited, empirical two-point correlation function (2PCF) analysis is conducted. Through this modelling approach, we account for the inhomogeneity present in the distribution of stellar objects as well as the effects of objects' properties on their spatial distributions. We confirm that the distribution of GMCs and YSCs are highly correlated and we found that the spatial distributions of GMCs and YSCs are clustered at approximately 200 to 500 pc scale compared to a Poisson process. Furthermore, the distance from GMCs to the galaxy center and the gas mass of GMCs have a strong positive effect on the number density of YSCs.","tags":null,"title":"Going Probablistic: Probing the Distributional Properties of Stellar Objects in M33 with Gibbs Point Process Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dayi Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"9dbaf71c015d7282e6187bf0435b4e06","permalink":"https://davidolohowski.github.io/publication/msc-thesis/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/msc-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"My thesis work","tags":null,"title":"Point Process Modelling of Stellar Objects in the M33 Galaxy","type":"publication"}]
