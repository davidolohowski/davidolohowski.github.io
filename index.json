Currently, the objects under consideration are ultra-diffuse galaxies.\nBefore coming to UofT, I obtained my bachelor degree in financial modelling in 2018 at Western University. Subsequently, I obtained my Masters degree in statistics in 2020 at Western University under the supervision of Ian McLeod and Pauline Barmby where I worked on spatial point process modelling of stellar objects in the M33 galaxy. I also worked a little bit on faciliating Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for certain models with intractable likelihood functions.\nIn general, I believe there is still an inadequacy of rigorous applications of advanced statistical methods in astronomy. Filling this inadequacy can bring about new understanding and discovery in astronomy and help us better understand the origin of the Universe. Therefore, I am interested in pushing proper statistical application in astronomy as well as developing new statistical methods to tackle challenging astronomical questions.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://davidolohowski.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. student in statistics advised by Gwen Eadie, Patrick Brown, and Roberto Abraham at the University of Toronto.

We conduct a rigorous analysis of the spatial distributions of objects in the star formation complexes of M33, including giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and young stellar cluster candidates (YSCCs). We choose a hierarchical model structure from GMCs to YSCCs based on the natural formation hierarchy between them. This approach circumvents the limitations of the empirical two-point correlation function analysis by naturally accounting for the inhomogeneity present in the distribution of YSCCs. We also investigate the effects of GMCs' properties on their spatial distributions. We confirm that the distribution of GMCs and YSCCs are highly correlated. We found that the spatial distributions of YSCCs reaches a peak of clustering pattern at around 250 pc scale compared to a Poisson process. This clustering mainly occurs in regions where the galactocentric distance is greater than 4.5 kpc. Furthermore, the galactocentric distance of GMCs and their mass have  strong positive effects on the correlation strength between GMCs and YSCCs. We outline some possible implications of these findings for our understanding of the cluster formation process.","tags":null,"title":"Gibbs Point Process Model for Young Star Clusters in M33","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My name My Chinese name is 李大一， 李 (Li, don't think there's any issue with how to pronounce it) is the family name; 大一 (Dah Yee) is my first name. Quite ironically, the literal translation of my first name is \u0026ldquo;Big One\u0026rdquo; while I am no where near anything big (although my head may have an above average size). Certainly, it doesn't carry the meaning of its literal translation, but I don't know what it really means since my dad is still not willing to tell me.\nHobbies I draw and doodle in my spare time. In fact, I was aiming for a career as an artist all the way till high school. But I dropped it as a career path due to multiple reasons and it ended up as a hobby after high school. It still provides me with a lot of calm and comfort, however, and I enjoy the absolute freedom when I let my imagination loose.\nI am also a die-hard Barcelona fan simply because of the GOAT \u0026mdash; Lionel Messi. I don't think there should be any debate on whether Messi or Ronaldo is the best player of the world because Ronaldo is simply not on the same level as Messi, as supported by the analysis and results found in the following paper:\nTom Decroos, Lotte Bransen, Jan Van Haaren, and Jesse Davis, (2019) Actions Speak Louder than Goals: Valuing Player Actions in Soccer, In The 25th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD ’19).\nI also quite enjoy classical musics as well as movie scores when I need to focus and study. Debussy and Mozart are probably on the top of my list. Interstellar and Star Wars soundtracks are simply genius.\nI am also an avid fantasy/sci-fi fan. It might be cliche, but Star Wars, LOTR and Harry Potter can always make me go on and on.\n","date":1578182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578182400,"objectID":"a3614d944aeab6d541f0abe4c02e8f65","permalink":"https://davidolohowski.github.io/about-me/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about-me/","section":"","summary":"bio","tags":null,"title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Astrostatistics is an emerging and fast-growing cross-disciplinary field. It is at the intersection of astrophysics and statistics; it encompasses the application of modern statistical methodologies to astrophysics research, as well as the development of novel statistical methodologies for astrophysics which can lead to application in other scientific disciplines.\nI am a trained statistician, my research interests in statistics are mainly spatial statistics, Bayesian inference/computation, as well as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.\nMy Ph.D. work will focus on developing novel methodology in spatial point processes to help astronomers better detect a class of newly-found galaxies called the ultra-diffuse galaxies(UDGs). These galaxies are very hard to detect in that they have extremely low surface brightness (some only have 1% of the stars of the Milky Way Galaxy) but can be as much or more massive than the Milky Way (due to dark matter). However, it has been found that many of these galaxies have a significant population of globular clusters which can be served as a tracer for the location of their home UDGs. Developing methods and models to discover more of these galaxies can shed new light on our understanding of the Universe.\nIn my Masters thesis, I worked on developing spatial point process models to investigate the spatial distribution of stellar objects (CO filament, giant molecular clouds, star clusters) in the M33 galaxy. This is a novel methodology in astronomy and it has led to potential new discoveries in the formation of young stellar clusters.\n","date":1578182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578182400,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://davidolohowski.github.io/research/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"research","tags":null,"title":"About my research","type":"page"},{"authors":["Dayi Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"9dbaf71c015d7282e6187bf0435b4e06","permalink":"https://davidolohowski.github.io/publication/msc-thesis/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/msc-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"My thesis work","tags":null,"title":"Point Process Modelling of Stellar Objects in the M33 Galaxy","type":"publication"}]
